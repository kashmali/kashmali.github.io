Hi all, my name is Aakash Mali and I'm a graduate from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering.
I love tinkering on different projects in my spare time that aid me in learning new technologies and designs.
This website showcases the different projects I've worked on.
