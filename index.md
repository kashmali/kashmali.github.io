## Bio

Hi all, my name is Aakash Mali and I'm a graduate from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering.
I love tinkering on different projects in my spare time that help me learn new technologies and designs. 
I'm passionate about robotics and love architecting embedded systems to control them.
This website showcases the different projects I've worked on and will be updated as I work on more projects!
